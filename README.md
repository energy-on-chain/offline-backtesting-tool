## [ STACK ]
- Python (key packages include pandas, numpy, fpdf, and smtplib for emails)
- Google Cloud Services (for pulling and storing real-time data)

## [ BACKGROUND ]
In addition to implementing trading strategies live on exchanges, it is also important to backtest your ideas so you are more likely to deploy the "winners". This tool was created to make the backtesting process quicker, simpler, and more fit-for-purpose when it comes to evaluating the most important performance metrics for a given trading strategy.
